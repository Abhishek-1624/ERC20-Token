# ERC20-Token

A token is designed to represent something of value but also things like voting rights  or discount vouchers, It can represent any fungible trading good

ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments. An ERC is a form of proposal and its purpose is to define standards and pratices

EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement proposal and makes changes to the actual code of Ethereum

ERC20 is a proposal that intends to standardize how a token contract should be defined how to interact with such a token contract and how these contracts
interact with each other, It is a standard interface used by applications such as wallets,decentralized exchanges and so on to interact with tokens

We need this token standard for interoperability,we use the same wallet in which we Store Ether to buy,sell or transfer token but what we are actually
doing is interacting with a contract

A token holder has full control over its tokens and the contract keeps track of the token ownership the same way The Ethereum network keeps track of 
who owns Eth

There are various types of tokens they are a fully ERC20 compliant and tokens that are partially ERC20 tokens, a fully-ERC20-compliant token
must have 6 functions and 2 events
